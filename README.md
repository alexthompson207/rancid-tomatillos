#### Accessibility 

We made accessibility a priority in our application. Rancid Tomatillos recieved a 97% acecessibility audit from Chrome's Lighthouse tool. Also using the Wave extension, our application has zero errors and contrast errors. 

#### Error Handling
To maintain a better user experience, we implemented dynamic error handling, so that a user will receive a unique error message based on the type of error.

#### Loading Screen
To create a more positive user experience, we implemented a loading message that will display while information is being retrieved from the API.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of React; class vs. function components, props, and Fetch requests
- Understand how to manage and update state
- Creating a controled form
- Create a multi-page UX using React Router
- Testing User Stories using `Cypress`

## Future Iterations

- The user would land on a login page which would give the the ability to have a profile and favorite movies that will be stored for later viewing. 
- Trending movies section that displayed the highest rated movies.
- Expand search functionality. Search by genre or filter by rating.
